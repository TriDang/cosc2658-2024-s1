1.1/ Find the largest number in an array

input: array A[0..N-1]
output: the largest number in A
assumption: all elements are unique

largest = A[0]
for i = 1 to N-1
  if largest < A[i]
    largest = A[i]
return largest

// alternative version: find the location of the largest number
// => useful if the "number" is an object with many attributes
// and the value we use for comparison is just one attribute

largestIdx = 0
for i = 1 to N-1
  if A[largestIdx] < A[i]
    largestIdx = i
return largestIdx


1.2/ Find the 2nd-largest number in an array

input: array A[0..N-1]
output: the 2nd-largest number in A
assumption: all elements are unique, N >= 2

if A[0] > A[1]
  largest = A[0]
  second = A[1]
else
  largest = A[1]
  second = A[0]

for i = 2 to N-1
  if largest < A[i]
    second = largest
    largest = A[i]
  else if second < A[i]
    second = A[i]

return second

// can you modify the above code
// to return the index of the second-largest number?

// second approach:
// find the largest number
// exchange the largest number with A[N-1] (the last element)
// find the largest number from 0 to N-2 only => it is the 2nd-largest number
