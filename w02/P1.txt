T(N) = 999*N - SQRT(N)

Select C = 999 and N0 = 1, we have

T(N) = 999*N - SQRT(N) < 999*N = C*N < C*(N^2), for N >= N0

=> (N^2) is the upper bound on T(N)
=> T(N) = O(N^2)

====
Notes: you can use the same process to prove that

T(N) = O(N^3)
T(N) = O(N*lg(N))
T(N) = O(N)
etc.

but not

T(N) = O(lg(N))
T(N) = O(SQRT(N))
etc.

===
If you want to denote a tight bound, use Big-Theta instead of Big-O
